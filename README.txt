Ultrasonic Distance Alert System Documentation üöóüîäüí°

Overview  
Hey! I built this Ultrasonic Distance Alert System that mimics a car parking sensor. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to measure distance, lights up LEDs via a shift register to visually show how close an object is, and sounds a buzzer with varying beep rates to alert me. Plus, I added a mute button to silence the buzzer when needed. I also included a serial bar indicator so I can see the distance feedback on my computer monitor. Cool, right? üòé

How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

1. Ultrasonic Sensor:  
   The sensor sends a high-frequency sound pulse (triggered via trigPin) and listens for the echo reflected by an obstacle (echoPin). The Arduino measures the time taken for the echo to return, calculates the distance using the speed of sound, and updates the distance value in centimeters.

2. Distance Zones & LED Indication:  
   The measured distance is categorized into four zones:

   - 0-30 cm: Closest zone ‚Äî Red LEDs light up.
   - 31-45 cm: Yellow LEDs.
   - 46-60 cm: Blue LEDs.
   - 61-80 cm: White LEDs.

   Each zone corresponds to a specific LED pair, controlled via the shift register. This visually shows how close the obstacle is.

3. Shift Register (74HC595):  
   The Arduino uses three pins to control the 8 LEDs through the shift register:

   - Data (DS): Arduino pin 8
   - Latch (ST_CP): Arduino pin 9
   - Clock (SH_CP): Arduino pin 10

   Using shiftOut(), the Arduino sends the LED pattern to the shift register, which lights up the correct LEDs.

4. Buzzer Alerts:  
   The buzzer on Arduino pin 5 beeps with different speeds depending on the distance zone ‚Äî faster beeps mean closer distance. The mute button on pin 11 lets me toggle the buzzer sound off/on. It uses an external 10kŒ© pull-down resistor.

5. Serial Monitor Bar Indicator:  
   I can open the Serial Monitor (baud rate 9600) on the Arduino IDE to see a simple bar graph representing distance, which helps visualize data alongside the LEDs and buzzer.
